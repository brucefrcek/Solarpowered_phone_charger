# Solarpowered_phone_charger
Created a solar powered phone charger by setting up multiple solar panels in series and connecting them to a battery.

The goal was to create a solar-powered phone charger. We ran into a blocker when we couldn’t find a good way to connect the solar panels to the powerbank module, which led us to a cool troubleshooting method—stripping the wires of a micro USB cable. After soldering the wires, everything worked! We were able to replicate this process with the participants, successfully teaching them not only how the device worked but also safe soldering techniques. Overall, it was a great experience for everyone!
